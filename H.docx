Survey Sampling Techniques: Volume-Based, Variance-Based, Multistage (Including Stratified)
1. Introduction: The Significance of Survey Sampling in Research
Survey sampling is a fundamental statistical method employed in research to gather information about a large group of individuals, known as the population, by studying a smaller, more manageable subgroup, referred to as the sample.1 This technique allows researchers to obtain precise and generalizable insights into the characteristics, attitudes, or behaviors of the broader population without the need to survey every single member.2 By selecting a representative group, survey sampling enables the collection of data that can be applied to the entire population of interest.1
The importance of choosing appropriate sampling methods cannot be overstated, as the validity and efficiency of research findings are directly influenced by the sampling process.8 Properly conducted survey sampling yields reliable results in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner.1 It plays a crucial role in data analysis, empowering researchers to draw dependable conclusions about the population without the significant expenditure of resources required for a full census.2 The primary goal of sampling is to ensure that the chosen sample accurately reflects the population, minimizing errors and biases that could skew the research outcomes.9
Survey sampling offers several key advantages that underscore its significance in research. It is highly cost-effective, as studying a smaller group drastically reduces the expenses associated with data collection, processing, and analysis.1 It also provides increased efficiency, allowing researchers to gather necessary information without the impracticality of surveying an entire population, especially one that is large or geographically dispersed.1 When executed correctly, survey sampling ensures generalizability, meaning the findings from the sample can be applied to the larger population, enabling researchers to make broad inferences and conclusions.1 Furthermore, surveys are versatile and practical research tools applicable to various research questions and objectives, even for complex or hard-to-reach populations.1 A well-designed sampling method can significantly contribute to reducing bias in the data, ensuring that the sample accurately represents the population's characteristics.1 The flexibility of surveys allows for adaptation to different data collection methods, such as online questionnaires, interviews, or mail surveys.1 In certain situations, especially those involving sensitive information, sampling can address ethical considerations by protecting the privacy and confidentiality of individuals since only a subset of the population is involved.1 Finally, smaller sample sizes are more manageable for feasibility of analysis, making it easier to process collected data and derive quicker results and insights.1
Survey sampling is a cornerstone of modern research, enabling investigators across diverse fields to gain valuable insights into populations that would otherwise be inaccessible. The strategic selection of a representative sample is paramount to the integrity and applicability of research findings, making the understanding and application of various sampling techniques essential for any researcher or analyst.
2. Volume-Based Sampling Techniques: An In-Depth Analysis
Volume-based sampling, while not a standard term in traditional survey methodology within social sciences, refers to sampling techniques where the quantity or volume of the sampled material is a primary consideration. This approach is particularly relevant in fields such as environmental science, where the detection and quantification of substances often depend on the amount of medium analyzed, and in certain areas of physics and computer graphics where the focus is on sampling points within a defined volume.
In environmental science, especially in the context of microplastics research, volume-based sampling is critical. Researchers collect a specific volume of water, air, or sediment to ensure a sufficient number of microplastic particles are captured for subsequent analysis.10 The sensitivity of the analysis, or the ability to detect small quantities of microplastics, is directly related to the volume of the sample processed.16
There are different types of volume-based sampling depending on the research objectives. Fixed volume sampling involves collecting a predetermined amount of the sample medium, such as 500 liters of water for microplastic analysis, regardless of the expected concentration or other factors.16 This standardization allows for comparisons across different samples and studies. Proportional volume sampling adjusts the volume based on certain characteristics. In forestry's point sampling technique, the effective area sampled around a tree is proportional to its basal area, a measure of its size.37 Larger trees, which are more significant for timber volume estimation, have a higher probability of selection, implying a larger sampled volume around them. Adaptive volume sampling is used in dynamic systems, where the sample volume might be adjusted during the process. For example, in simulating fluid dynamics, regions with more activity might require a higher density of sample points, thus an effectively larger volume is sampled in those areas.49
Volume-based sampling finds applications in various fields. In environmental science, particularly for microplastic pollution, researchers sample water from diverse sources like rivers, oceans, and drinking water to quantify the presence and concentration of these pollutants.10 The volume sampled is a key factor in determining the reliability of the findings. In particle physics simulations, volume sampling is used to generate initial particle positions or to represent objects within the simulation space.49 These techniques often aim for a uniform or blue noise distribution of sample points within the volume. In forestry, point sampling relies on the volume of space around a sampling point, where the probability of a tree's inclusion is proportional to its size, thus effectively sampling a volume of the forest stand.37
Volume-based sampling has several advantages. In environmental studies, it allows for the detection of even trace amounts of substances by processing larger quantities of the medium.16 In forestry, point sampling is efficient because it focuses on the larger trees, which are the primary contributors to timber volume and value.39 For simulations, these techniques can ensure a spatially uniform and unbiased distribution of sample points.49 However, there are also disadvantages. Determining the appropriate sample volume can be challenging and may require prior knowledge of the system or pilot studies.14 In microplastic sampling, using too small a volume might result in missing particles, especially if their concentration is low, while sampling an excessively large volume can lead to practical issues such as clogging of filters.16 Accurate calibration of sampling equipment to ensure precise volume measurement is also crucial.38
The mathematical foundations of volume-based sampling vary depending on the application. In microplastic research, the Poisson point process is often employed to model the spatial distribution of microplastics within a water body, assuming a random dispersion pattern.13 Statistical formulas based on the Poisson distribution are used to estimate the required sample volume needed to achieve a desired level of confidence in detecting microplastics at a given concentration.14 The Representative Sample Volume Predictor (RSVP) tool utilizes this statistical framework to standardize the prediction of sufficient sample volumes.13 In forestry's point sampling, mathematical formulas relate the diameter of a tree, its distance from the sampling point, and the basal area factor (BAF) of the sampling instrument to determine whether the tree is included in the sample.37 Additionally, formulas are used to estimate the basal area per hectare (BA/ha) by multiplying the number of sampled trees by the BAF, and further calculations can estimate timber volume based on the basal area and other tree characteristics.37
3. Variance-Based Sampling Techniques: Understanding Data Dispersion
Variance-based sampling techniques are distinguished by their explicit consideration of the variability or dispersion within the population being studied. The primary objective of these methods is often to enhance the efficiency and precision of estimates, particularly when dealing with populations that exhibit heterogeneity. By strategically selecting samples, these techniques aim to account for the fact that certain segments of the population may have greater variability than others.
A prominent example of a variance-based sampling technique is Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling. In PPS sampling, the probability of selecting a sampling unit is directly proportional to its size, where size is typically a measure related to the variable of interest. This approach is particularly advantageous when larger units contribute more significantly to the overall population variance. For instance, in a survey of businesses, larger companies (in terms of revenue or number of employees) would have a higher chance of being selected. PPS sampling can be implemented with replacement, where a unit can be selected multiple times, or without replacement.
Another variance-based technique is Ranked Set Sampling (RSS).60 While not directly based on initial variance, RSS aims to improve sampling efficiency when units can be easily and inexpensively ranked relative to the variable of interest, even if precise measurement is difficult or costly. The process involves selecting small sets of units, ranking them based on a visual or other quick assessment, and then measuring only one unit from each set according to its rank. RSS can be extended by incorporating the principle of PPS, resulting in Ranked Set Sampling with Probability Proportional to Size (RPPS), which has been shown to be more reliable and have a smaller variance than standard PPS in certain applications.60
Variance-based sampling techniques find applications across a range of research contexts. In economics, PPS sampling is commonly used in surveys designed to estimate economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI).60 By giving larger economic entities, such as high-volume retailers, a greater probability of selection, the sample is more likely to accurately reflect the overall price levels experienced by consumers. In forestry, point sampling, where trees are selected with a probability proportional to their basal area (a measure of size), can be considered a variance-based approach as it focuses on the trees that are the most significant contributors to the timber volume of a stand.37 PPS sampling can also be utilized in large-scale forest inventories that employ remote sensing data.65 In healthcare, PPS sampling can be used to select healthcare providers or institutions for surveys with a probability proportional to the number of patients they serve, ensuring that larger entities are adequately represented in the sample.61
Variance-based sampling offers several advantages. PPS sampling can enhance the accuracy of estimates for the total population by giving larger units a proportionally greater chance of selection, ensuring that the sample more accurately reflects the population structure.61 It can also lead to a more cost-effective study by focusing resources on the larger, often more important, elements of the population.61 RSS can provide more informative samples compared to simple random sampling, especially in situations where ranking units is easier or more cost-effective than obtaining precise measurements.60 However, variance-based sampling also has disadvantages. PPS sampling requires a known measure of size for each element in the population, which may not always be readily available or easy to determine.61 The method can be more complex and potentially more costly to implement compared to simpler sampling techniques.61 The selection of an inappropriate size measure can introduce bias into the results.61 Researchers also need to carefully consider how to handle units with zero or negligible size within the population.61 Over-sampling of large units, which can occur in PPS, might lead to a less diverse sample if smaller but significant units are overlooked.61 Finally, the calculation of weights in PPS sampling can be complex and may require specialized software and careful checking.61
The mathematical underpinnings of variance-based sampling are crucial to its application. In PPS sampling, the probability of selection for each unit i is calculated based on its size xi​ and the total size of the population ∑j=1N​xj​. A common formula for the probability of selection with replacement is pi​=∑j=1N​xj​xi​​.61 Estimators for population parameters, such as the total or the mean, are often weighted by the inverse of the selection probability (1/pi​) to ensure that the estimates are unbiased.41 Variance estimation in PPS sampling must take into account the unequal probabilities of selection to provide accurate measures of the sampling error.66 RSS involves statistical analysis based on the ranks of the selected units, and specific formulas are used to estimate population parameters, often showing improved precision over SRS.60 The combination of RSS with PPS (RPPS) integrates the size of the units into the ranking and selection process, requiring more complex mathematical models for estimation and variance calculation.60
4. Multistage Sampling Techniques: A Hierarchical Approach
Multistage sampling, also known as multistage cluster sampling, is a probability sampling technique particularly well-suited for surveying large and geographically dispersed populations.67 It involves selecting the sample in stages, moving from larger to smaller sampling units at each step. This hierarchical approach makes it feasible to conduct research when a complete list of all individuals in the population is either unavailable or impractical to compile.67
The process of multistage sampling typically involves several stages. At the first stage, the researcher selects primary sampling units (PSUs), which are large clusters such as states, regions, or school districts.68 These PSUs are chosen using a probability sampling method like simple random sampling, systematic sampling, or stratified sampling.83 At the second stage, within each of the selected PSUs, the researcher selects secondary sampling units (SSUs), which are smaller clusters such as cities, neighborhoods, or individual schools.68 Again, a probability sampling method is employed for this selection.83 The process can continue with third and subsequent stages, where the SSUs are further divided into even smaller clusters or where the ultimate sampling units (USUs), which are the individual members of the population (e.g., households, students, individuals), are selected from the previously chosen units.68 The number of stages in a multistage sample design depends on the complexity and scale of the population and the specific needs of the research.75
The implementation of multistage sampling can be illustrated through several examples. In two-stage sampling, a researcher might first select a sample of schools (PSUs) and then, within each selected school, choose a sample of students (SSUs) to survey.83 A three-stage sampling design could involve selecting counties as PSUs, then choosing a sample of households within those counties as SSUs, and finally selecting one individual from each of the sampled households as the USUs.78 Large-scale national surveys often utilize multistage designs. For instance, the Australian Bureau of Statistics employs a four-stage process for its household surveys, starting with the selection of metropolitan regions, followed by collection districts, then blocks within those districts, and finally selecting specific dwellings within the blocks.69 The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) in the United States uses a multistage design that includes counties as PSUs, segments within counties as SSUs, then households within those segments, and ultimately individuals within the households.85
A key characteristic of multistage sampling is the use of probability sampling methods at each stage to ensure that the final sample is representative of the target population.66 Common probability sampling techniques such as simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling can be applied at different stages of the multistage process, often in combination.66 For example, at the first stage, primary sampling units (PSUs) might be selected using probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling, while at the second stage, secondary sampling units (SSUs) are chosen using simple random sampling.84
Determining the appropriate sample size in multistage sampling is a more intricate task compared to single-stage designs. It requires consideration of the number of stages involved, the size and variability of clusters at each stage, and the desired level of precision for the survey estimates.91 A key concept often used in this context is the design effect, which is a measure of how much larger the required sample size needs to be in a complex sampling design (like multistage sampling) compared to a simple random sample to achieve the same level of precision.91 The design effect accounts for the correlation among individuals within the same clusters.
5. Stratified Sampling: A Targeted Multistage Technique
Stratified sampling is a widely used and specific type of probability sampling that can be implemented as a single-stage design or as part of a multistage sampling process.68 It involves the crucial first step of dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups, known as strata, based on one or more relevant characteristics before any sampling takes place.7 The primary objective of this technique is to enhance the precision of the sample and reduce sampling error by ensuring that all key subgroups within the population are adequately represented.7
Effective stratification relies on several key criteria. First, the strata must be mutually exclusive, meaning every member of the population can be classified into only one stratum, and collectively exhaustive, ensuring that all members of the population are included in some stratum.118 Second, the characteristic(s) used to form the strata should be relevant to the research question and ideally correlated with the variable(s) of interest.118 Common stratification variables include demographics such as age, gender, income level, education, and geographic location.118 Third, the population within each stratum should be as homogeneous as possible with respect to the characteristics being studied. This minimizes the variability within each stratum and maximizes the differences between strata, which ultimately leads to more precise estimates.101
Once the population has been divided into strata, the next step is to determine the sample size for each stratum using various allocation methods.126 Proportional allocation is a common method where the sample size in each stratum is proportional to the stratum's size in the overall population.126 For example, if a stratum represents 20% of the population, it would also constitute 20% of the sample. The formula for proportional allocation is often given as nh​=n×(Nh​/N), where nh​ is the sample size for stratum h, Nh​ is the population size of stratum h, N is the total population size, and n is the total sample size.127 Optimal allocation, also known as Neyman allocation, aims to minimize the variance of the stratified estimator for a fixed total sample size. This method considers both the size and the variability (standard deviation) within each stratum, allocating larger sample sizes to strata that are more variable.107 Equal allocation involves dividing the total sample size equally among all strata, regardless of their size or variability; while simple, it might not be the most efficient statistically.126 Disproportionate allocation is used when the sample sizes in different strata are not proportional to their population sizes. This can be useful for oversampling small or highly variable strata to ensure sufficient representation or to improve the precision of estimates for those specific strata.104 Cost-based allocation is a specific type of disproportionate allocation that also takes into account the cost of sampling in each stratum.127

7. Exploring Novel and Hybrid Sampling Approaches
The field of survey sampling is dynamic, with researchers continually exploring novel and hybrid approaches to overcome the limitations of traditional methods and to address the complexities of contemporary research environments.112 Hybrid approaches often involve the integration of probability and non-probability sampling techniques or the combination of different probability sampling methods to tackle specific research challenges.112 For instance, researchers might use stratified random sampling to ensure representation of key demographic groups and then employ convenience sampling to reach participants within those groups who are easily accessible.135 Adaptive sampling is another innovative technique where the sampling process is adjusted as new information becomes available during the study, allowing for a more responsive and efficient data collection.145
When designing a new sampling technique, several critical factors must be considered.4 The primary driver should be the specific research goals, including the types of inferences the researcher aims to make and the level of precision required. The structure of the population, such as its size, geographic distribution, and heterogeneity, will also dictate the feasibility and appropriateness of different techniques. Finally, available resources, including budget, time constraints, and the expertise of the research team, will play a significant role in the design and implementation of any sampling method. It is also crucial to consider potential sources of bias and how the new technique might mitigate or exacerbate these issues.113
Research literature provides examples of innovative sampling techniques. LEAVEN is a novel tool used in particle physics to generate random volume samples with blue noise distribution by modifying a surface sampling algorithm.49 In economic research, the extension of Ranked Set Sampling (RSS) with Probability Proportional to Size (RPPS) has been shown to improve the reliability and reduce the variance of estimates compared to standard PPS.60 For handling imbalanced datasets in machine learning, various hybrid resampling methods have been developed that combine oversampling of minority classes and undersampling of majority classes.136 The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in sampling is also emerging, with algorithms being used to analyze complex datasets and optimize sample selection.145 Random Domain Intercept Technology (RDIT) is an innovative approach for online surveys that aims to capture opinions from a broader range of web users, including those who might not participate in traditional online panels.146 These examples highlight the ongoing evolution of sampling techniques to meet the diverse needs of research across different domains.
8. Conclusion
The array of survey sampling techniques available to researchers offers a spectrum of approaches tailored to different research questions, population characteristics, and resource constraints. Volume-based sampling, while not a traditional survey method, is crucial in fields like environmental science and physics, where the quantity of the sample directly influences the data quality and the ability to detect phenomena.

1. Introduction: The Significance of Survey Sampling in Research
Survey sampling is a cornerstone of statistical methodology, providing a structured approach for gathering information about a large group of individuals, known as the population, by examining a smaller, representative subset, or sample.1 This technique is fundamental to research across a multitude of disciplines, enabling investigators to derive meaningful conclusions about the entire population without the often prohibitive costs and logistical challenges of surveying every individual.2 By carefully selecting a sample that mirrors the characteristics of the broader population, researchers can obtain precise and generalizable insights into various attributes, attitudes, or behaviors.2
The importance of selecting an appropriate sampling method cannot be overstated. The validity, reliability, and efficiency of research findings are intrinsically linked to how the sample is chosen.8 Properly executed survey sampling ensures that the results obtained from the sample can be confidently extended to the population from which it was drawn, providing a cost-effective and time-efficient means of data collection.1 Sampling plays a pivotal role in the analytical process, allowing researchers to make informed inferences about the population without the need for exhaustive enumeration, which is often impractical, especially for large or geographically dispersed groups.2 The fundamental aim of sampling is to secure a subset that accurately represents the population, thereby minimizing errors and biases that could compromise the integrity of the research outcomes.9
Survey sampling offers a multitude of advantages that highlight its critical role in research. Cost-effectiveness is a primary benefit, as studying a fraction of the population significantly reduces the financial burden associated with data collection, processing, and analysis.1 It also leads to increased efficiency, enabling researchers to gather necessary information in a timely manner, which is particularly valuable when dealing with large or geographically spread populations.1 When implemented correctly, survey sampling ensures generalizability, allowing the findings from the sample to be applied to the larger population, thus supporting broader conclusions and inferences.1 Surveys are versatile and practical tools that can be adapted to various research questions and objectives, making it feasible to study complex or hard-to-reach populations for which a census might not be possible.1 The use of well-designed sampling methods is crucial for reducing bias in the data, ensuring that the sample accurately reflects the characteristics of the population and leads to valid conclusions.1 The flexibility of survey methods allows for their application across different data collection approaches, including online questionnaires, in-person or telephone interviews, and mail surveys.1 In certain contexts, especially when dealing with sensitive or personal information, sampling can address ethical considerations by protecting the privacy and confidentiality of individuals, as only a subset of the population is involved.1 Finally, smaller sample sizes are more manageable for feasibility of analysis, simplifying data processing and leading to quicker results and insights.1
In essence, survey sampling is an indispensable technique in the realm of research, providing a robust and efficient means to understand the characteristics of large populations. The careful selection of an appropriate sampling method is paramount to the success and validity of any research endeavor, directly influencing the quality and generalizability of the findings across a wide spectrum of disciplines.
2. Volume-Based Sampling Techniques: An In-Depth Analysis
Volume-based sampling, while not a conventional term in the lexicon of traditional survey methodology within social sciences, refers to a collection of sampling techniques where the quantity or volume of the sampled material or space is a key determinant in the process. This approach is predominantly utilized in fields such as environmental science, particularly in the study of pollutants, and in specific areas of physics and computer graphics where the focus lies on examining or generating elements within a defined volume.
In environmental science, especially within the context of microplastics research, volume-based sampling is of paramount importance. Researchers meticulously collect a specified quantity of water, air, or sediment to ensure that a representative number of microplastic particles are captured for subsequent laboratory analysis.10 The sensitivity of the analytical methods used, and consequently the ability to detect and quantify low concentrations of microplastics, is directly proportional to the volume of the sample that is processed.16
Several types of volume-based sampling exist, tailored to the specific objectives of the research. Fixed volume sampling involves the collection of a pre-established amount of the medium being studied. For instance, a standard protocol in microplastic research might dictate the collection of a 500-liter water sample from a given location.16 The volume remains constant across different sampling events, facilitating standardization and comparability of results. Proportional volume sampling adjusts the quantity of the sample based on certain characteristics or expectations related to the population or phenomenon under investigation. In forestry, point sampling operates on this principle; the effective area around a sampling point from which a tree is selected is proportional to the tree's basal area, a measure of its size.37 Larger trees, which are more significant in terms of overall timber volume, have a higher likelihood of being included in the sample, thus representing a larger sampled volume. Adaptive volume sampling is employed in dynamic or complex systems where the sample volume might be adjusted during the sampling process in response to preliminary findings or real-time data. An example is in particle-based fluid simulations, where the sampling density might be increased in regions of high fluid activity or turbulent flow to capture the dynamics more accurately.49
The applications of volume-based sampling are diverse. In environmental science, particularly for microplastic pollution, researchers sample water from various sources, including rivers 10, oceans 15, and sources of drinking water 11, by filtering a specific volume to extract and quantify the microplastic particles. The chosen volume is a critical factor in the number of particles detected and the reliability of the concentration estimates.14 In particle physics simulations, volume sampling is essential for setting the initial positions of particles within a defined simulation space or for representing solid objects in simulations involving fluids or other materials.49 These techniques often aim to achieve a uniform and unbiased distribution of sample points throughout the volume, sometimes adhering to specific criteria like blue noise distribution. In forestry, point sampling utilizes the concept of a variable radius plot centered at a sampling point. The probability of a tree being selected for measurement is proportional to its basal area, effectively making it a volume-based approach where larger trees, which contribute more to the stand's timber volume, are more likely to be sampled.37
Volume-based sampling presents several advantages. In environmental monitoring, it allows for the detection of even minute concentrations of substances by processing large volumes of the sample medium.16 In forestry, point sampling is an efficient method as it focuses on the larger trees, which are the primary determinants of timber volume and economic value.38 For simulations, these techniques provide a direct and intuitive way to populate the simulation environment with representative elements.49 However, there are also disadvantages. Determining the appropriate volume to sample can be a significant challenge and may necessitate prior knowledge of the system under study or the execution of pilot studies to optimize the volume.14 In the context of microplastic sampling, collecting too small a volume might lead to an underestimation of particle concentrations, particularly if the particles are sparsely distributed, whereas sampling an excessively large volume can be resource-intensive and may lead to practical difficulties such as the clogging of filtration systems.16 Furthermore, the accurate calibration of equipment used for volume measurement is essential to ensure the reliability of the sampled data.38
The mathematical foundations and statistical formulas underpinning volume-based sampling are context-dependent. In microplastic research, the Poisson point process is frequently used to model the spatial distribution of microplastic particles within a given volume of water, based on the assumption that their occurrence follows a random process.13 Statistical formulas derived from the Poisson distribution are then applied to estimate the sample volume required to achieve a certain level of confidence in detecting microplastics at a particular concentration.14 The Representative Sample Volume Predictor (RSVP) tool is an example of a resource that utilizes this statistical framework to standardize the determination of adequate sample volumes for microplastic studies.13 In forestry, point sampling relies on geometric principles and statistical factors. The probability of a tree's selection is proportional to its basal area, and the basal area factor (BAF) of the instrument used (such as a prism or angle gauge) dictates the amount of basal area per hectare that each sampled tree represents.37 Formulas are used to calculate the basal area per hectare (BA/ha = Number of sampled trees × BAF) and to further estimate the timber volume based on this basal area and other measured tree attributes.37
3. Variance-Based Sampling Techniques: Understanding Data Dispersion
Variance-based sampling techniques are distinguished by their explicit consideration of the variability or dispersion within the population being studied. The primary objective of these methods is often to enhance the efficiency and precision of estimates, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous populations. These techniques strategically select samples to account for the fact that some segments of the population may exhibit greater variability than others.
A prominent example of a variance-based sampling technique is Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling. In PPS sampling, the probability of selecting a sampling unit is directly proportional to its size, where size is typically a measure related to the variable of interest. This approach is particularly advantageous when larger units contribute more significantly to the overall population variance. For instance, in a survey of businesses, larger companies (in terms of revenue or number of employees) would have a higher chance of being selected. PPS sampling can be implemented with replacement, where a unit can be selected multiple times, or without replacement.
Another variance-based technique is Ranked Set Sampling (RSS).60 While not strictly defined by initial variance, RSS is a technique that can be used to improve the efficiency of sampling when units can be easily and cheaply ranked relative to the variable of interest, even if actual measurement is difficult or expensive.60 The process involves selecting small sets of units, ranking them based on a visual or other quick assessment, and then measuring only one unit from each set according to its rank. This method can be extended by incorporating the principle of PPS, resulting in Ranked Set Sampling with Probability Proportional to Size (RPPS), which has been shown to be more reliable and have a smaller variance than standard PPS in certain applications.60
Variance-based sampling techniques find applications across a range of research contexts. In economics, PPS sampling is frequently used in surveys designed to estimate economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI).60 By giving larger retail outlets or businesses a higher probability of selection, the sample is more likely to accurately reflect the overall price levels experienced by consumers. In forestry, point sampling, a common method for timber inventory, can be viewed as a form of variance-based sampling. Trees are selected with a probability proportional to their basal area, which is a measure of their size and contribution to the stand's volume.37 PPS sampling can also be employed in large-scale forest inventories using remote sensing data.65 In healthcare, when conducting surveys of healthcare providers or institutions, PPS sampling can ensure that larger entities (e.g., hospitals with more beds or clinics with more patients 61) are adequately represented, as they often account for a significant portion of the overall healthcare delivery.
Variance-based sampling offers several advantages. PPS sampling increases the precision of estimates for the total population by giving larger units a proportionally greater chance of selection, ensuring that the sample more accurately reflects the population structure.61 It can also lead to a more cost-effective study by focusing resources on the larger, often more important, elements of the population.61 RSS can yield more informative samples compared to simple random sampling, especially in situations where ranking units is easier or more cost-effective than obtaining precise measurements.60 However, variance-based sampling also has disadvantages. PPS sampling requires a known measure of size for each element in the population, which may not always be readily available or easy to determine.61 The method can be more time-consuming and costly compared to simpler techniques.61 Choosing an inappropriate size measure can lead to biased results.61 Handling units with zero or negligible size needs careful consideration.61 Over-sampling of large units, which can occur in PPS, might lead to a less diverse sample if smaller but significant units are overlooked.61 Finally, the calculation of weights in PPS sampling can be complex and may require specialized software and careful checking.61
The mathematical underpinnings of variance-based sampling are crucial to its application. In PPS sampling, the probability of selection for each unit i is calculated based on its size xi​ and the total size of the population ∑j=1N​xj​. A common formula for the probability of selection with replacement is pi​=∑j=1N​xj​xi​​.61 Estimators for population parameters, such as the total or the mean, are often weighted by the inverse of these selection probabilities (1/pi​) to ensure that the estimates are unbiased.41 Variance estimation in PPS sampling must take into account the unequal probabilities of selection to provide accurate measures of the sampling error.66 RSS relies on the concept of perfect or imperfect ranking of sampling units. Statistical inference in RSS is based on the ranked data, and formulas are developed to estimate population parameters with improved precision compared to SRS.60 The extension of RSS to PPS (RPPS) involves incorporating the size of the units into the ranking and selection process, requiring more complex mathematical models for estimation and variance calculation.60
4. Multistage Sampling Techniques: A Hierarchical Approach
Multistage sampling, also known as multistage cluster sampling, is a probability sampling technique particularly well-suited for surveying large and geographically dispersed populations.67 It involves selecting the sample in stages, using smaller and smaller sampling units at each step. This hierarchical approach makes it feasible to conduct research when a complete list of all individuals in the population is either unavailable or impractical to compile.67
The process of multistage sampling typically involves several stages. At the first stage, the researcher selects primary sampling units (PSUs), which are large clusters such as states, regions, or school districts.68 These PSUs are chosen using a probability sampling method like simple random sampling, systematic sampling, or stratified sampling.83 At the second stage, within each of the selected PSUs, the researcher then selects secondary sampling units (SSUs), which are smaller clusters such as cities, neighborhoods, or individual schools.68 Again, a probability sampling method is used for this selection.83 The process can continue with third and subsequent stages, where the SSUs are further divided into even smaller clusters or where the ultimate sampling units (USUs), which are the individual members of the population (e.g., households, students, individuals), are selected from the previously chosen units.68 The number of stages in a multistage sample design depends on the complexity and scale of the population and the specific needs of the research.75
The implementation of multistage sampling can be illustrated through several examples. In two-stage sampling, a common scenario involves selecting a sample of schools (PSUs) and then, within each selected school, choosing a sample of students (SSUs) to survey.83 A three-stage sampling design might involve selecting counties as PSUs, then choosing a sample of households within those counties as SSUs, and finally selecting one individual from each of the sampled households as the USUs.78 Large-scale national surveys often utilize multistage designs. For instance, the Australian Bureau of Statistics employs a four-stage process for its household surveys, starting with the selection of metropolitan regions, followed by collection districts, then blocks within those districts, and finally selecting specific dwellings within the blocks.69 The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) in the United States uses a multistage design that includes counties as PSUs, segments within counties as SSUs, then households within those segments, and ultimately individuals within the households.85
A key characteristic of multistage sampling is the use of probability sampling methods at each stage to ensure that the final sample is representative of the target population.66 Common probability sampling techniques such as simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling can be applied at different stages of the multistage process, often in combination.66 For example, at the first stage, primary sampling units (PSUs) might be selected using probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling, while at the second stage, secondary sampling units (SSUs) are chosen using simple random sampling.84
Determining the appropriate sample size in multistage sampling is a complex process that needs to consider the number of stages, the size of clusters at each stage, and the desired level of precision.91 A key concept often used in this context is the design effect, which is a measure of how much larger the required sample size needs to be in a complex sampling design (like multistage sampling) compared to a simple random sample to achieve the same level of precision.91 The design effect accounts for the correlation among individuals within the same clusters.
5. Stratified Sampling: A Targeted Multistage Technique
Stratified sampling is a widely used and specific type of probability sampling that can be implemented as a single-stage design or as part of a multistage sampling process.68 It involves the crucial first step of dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups, or strata, based on one or more relevant characteristics before any sampling takes place.7 It can be implemented as a single-stage design or as part of a multistage sampling process, where stratification might occur at one or more stages.67
The primary goal of stratification is to enhance the precision of the sample and reduce sampling error. This is achieved by ensuring that each important subgroup within the population is adequately represented in the sample, which is particularly beneficial when the subgroups have different characteristics related to the variable of interest.7
Effective stratification relies on several key criteria. First, the strata must be mutually exclusive, meaning each member of the population can be classified into only one stratum, and collectively exhaustive, ensuring that all members of the population are included in some stratum.118 Second, the characteristic(s) used to define the strata should be relevant to the research question and ideally correlated with the variable(s) being studied.118 Common characteristics include demographics such as age, gender, income level, education, and geographic location.118 Third, the population within each stratum should be as homogeneous as possible with respect to the characteristics of interest. This minimizes the variability within each stratum and maximizes the differences between strata, which ultimately leads to more precise estimates.101
Once the population has been divided into strata, the next step is to determine the sample size for each stratum using various allocation methods.126 Proportional allocation is a common method where the sample size in each stratum is proportional to the stratum's size in the overall population.126 For example, if a stratum represents 20% of the population, it would also constitute 20% of the sample. The formula for proportional allocation is often given as nh​=n×(Nh​/N), where nh​ is the sample size for stratum h, Nh​ is the population size of stratum h, N is the total population size, and n is the total sample size.127 Optimal allocation, also known as Neyman allocation, aims to minimize the variance of the stratified estimator for a fixed total sample size by considering both the size and the variability within each stratum. Strata with larger sizes and greater variability receive larger sample sizes. The formula often involves the standard deviation of the variable of interest within each stratum.107 Equal allocation involves dividing the total sample size equally among all strata, regardless of their size or variability; while simple, it might not be the most efficient statistically.126 Disproportionate allocation is used when the sample sizes in different strata are not proportional to their population sizes. This can be useful for oversampling small or highly variable strata to ensure sufficient representation or to improve the precision of estimates for those specific strata.104 Cost-based allocation is a specific type of disproportionate allocation that also takes into account the cost of sampling in each stratum.127

7. Exploring Novel and Hybrid Sampling Approaches
The field of survey sampling is continuously evolving, with researchers exploring novel and hybrid techniques to overcome the limitations of traditional methods and to address the complexities of modern research environments.112 Hybrid approaches often involve the integration of probability and non-probability methods or the combination of different probability sampling techniques to tackle specific research challenges.112 For example, stratified random sampling can be combined with convenience sampling to ensure representation of key subgroups while also being practical for reaching certain segments of the population.135 Adaptive sampling is another innovative technique where the sampling process is adjusted as new information becomes available during the study, allowing for a more responsive and efficient data collection.145
When designing a new sampling technique, several critical factors must be considered.4 The design should be guided by the specific objectives of the research, the characteristics and heterogeneity of the target population, and the practical limitations of available resources such as time, budget, and personnel. Minimizing potential biases should also be a key consideration.113
Research literature provides examples of innovative sampling techniques. LEAVEN is a novel tool used in particle physics to generate random volume samples with blue noise distribution by modifying a surface sampling algorithm.49 In economic research, the extension of Ranked Set Sampling (RSS) with Probability Proportional to Size (RPPS) has been shown to improve the reliability and reduce the variance of estimates compared to standard PPS.60 For handling imbalanced datasets in machine learning, various hybrid resampling methods have been developed that combine oversampling of minority classes and undersampling of majority classes.136 The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in sampling is also emerging, with algorithms being used to analyze complex datasets and optimize sample selection.145 Random Domain Intercept Technology (RDIT) is an innovative approach for online surveys that aims to capture opinions from a broader range of web users, including those who might not participate in traditional online panels.146 These examples highlight the ongoing evolution of sampling techniques to meet the diverse needs of research across different domains.
8. Conclusion
The selection of an appropriate survey sampling technique is a critical decision that significantly impacts the validity, efficiency, and accuracy of research findings. Volume-based sampling, with its focus on the quantity of the sampled medium or space, is essential in fields like environmental science and physics. Variance-based sampling, such as Probability Proportional to Size (PPS), offers a strategic approach to handle heterogeneous populations by weighting units based on their size or variability. Multistage sampling provides a practical and cost-effective method for studying large and dispersed populations through a hierarchical selection process. Stratified sampling enhances the representativeness and precision of survey results by dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups before sampling.
The suitability of each technique depends on the specific research objectives, the characteristics of the target population, and the available resources. As research questions become more complex and populations more diverse, the exploration and development of novel and hybrid sampling approaches will continue to be crucial. These innovative methods, often leveraging technological advancements and statistical insights, aim to overcome the limitations of traditional techniques and provide researchers with more effective tools for data collection and analysis. Ultimately, the goal of any sampling technique is to obtain a representative subset of the population that allows for robust and generalizable conclusions, thereby advancing knowledge across various fields of study.
